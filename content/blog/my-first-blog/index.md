### Lets find out who is Mayank Suman and what he is going to post here.

Hi 👋🏼, I am Mayank Suman a frontend engineer who is creating and fixing UIs for over 9 years. I am working as a Senior associate with Simpplr. I am well-versed in and learning more technologies like HTML, CSS, JS and their related frameworks / Libraries like **reactJS**, etc, etc.

I will kick-start my blog post hobby with some daily gotchas that come up in a frontend dev life and try to fix them.

I've been playing around with these techs., please check out some of the projects on my [github](https://github.com/mayank-suman/).

Thanks for being here so long and reading my first blog. 🥂
